# **Part 1: Interactive Data Dashboard**



•  **two** different metrics or key performance indicators computed using data from _both_ chosen data sets
- Try to increase the contract lengtht to one year or two years.
- Increase the use of bandwidth per year for each customer

Steps to downloading the data and using the dashboard
1. download the two datasets
2. download the Tableau workbook
3. click on the Contract dashboard 
4. Click on the filters to see different aggregations of the data. 

# **Part 2: Storytelling with Data**

B.  Provide a link to a Panopto multimedia presentation in which you tell a story about the data to an audience of data analytics peers. Your presentation should implement elements of effective storytelling and include _each_ of the following elements:

•  an introduction of yourself and your background

•  a summary of _both_ chosen data sets and the context in which they occur

•  an outline of key results from your analysis of the two data sets

•  **two** different data representations to serve as supporting evidence for your results

•  a summary of actionable insights based on your results

# **Part 3: Reflection Paper**

C.  Write a reflection paper to demonstrate your understanding of data representation and reporting by doing the following:

1.  Explain how the purpose and function of your dashboard align with the needs outlined in the data dictionary associated with your chosen data set.
- The purpose of the dashboard is to provide a visualization on how contract length correlates with churning. Customers who have a month-to-month typically churn 37% while customers who have a year or longer contract churn only 15% of the time.

2.  Explain how the variables in the additional data set enhance the insights that can be drawn from the data set you chose from the provided options.
- The variables in the additional data set further illustrates how contract length correlates with churning. Customers who have a month-to-month contract typically churn 30% percent more than other customers who have longer contracts. 

3.  Explain **two** different data representations from your dashboard and how executive leaders can use them to support decision-making.

5.  Describe how you built your dashboard to be accessible for individuals with colorblindness.

6.  Explain how **two** data representations in your presentation support the story you wanted to tell.

7.  Explain how you used audience analysis to adapt the message in your presentation.

8.  Describe how you designed your presentation for universal access by all audiences.

9.  Explain **two** elements of effective storytelling that you implemented in your presentation and how _each_ element was intended to engage the audience.
