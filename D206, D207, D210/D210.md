•  **two** different metrics or key performance indicators computed using data from _both_ chosen data sets
- Try to increase the contract length to one year or two years.
- Increase the use of bandwidth per year for each customer

Steps to downloading the data and using the dashboard
1. download the two datasets
2. download the Tableau workbook
3. click on the Contract dashboard 
4. Click on the filters to see different aggregations of the data. 



# **Part 3: Reflection Paper**

C.  Write a reflection paper to demonstrate your understanding of data representation and reporting by doing the following:

1.  Explain how the purpose and function of your dashboard align with the needs outlined in the data dictionary associated with your chosen data set.
- The purpose of the dashboard is to provide a visualization of how contract length correlates with churning. Customers who have a month-to-month typically churn 37%, while customers who have a year or more extended contract churn only 15% of the time.

2.  Explain how the variables in the additional data set enhance the insights that can be drawn from the data set you chose from the provided options.
- The variables in the additional data set further illustrate how contract length correlates with churning. Customers who have a month-to-month contract typically churn 30% percent more than other customers who have more extended agreements. 

3.  Explain **two** different data representations from your dashboard and how executive leaders can use them to support decision-making.

- Executive leaders could push the sales team to push for more extended contracts. In addition, the executive leaders could propose 3, 6, or 9-month contracts. Customers then would get a chance to try out all the services.

- To further illustrate this point, we looked at another dataset on how contract lengths affect churning. The longer the contracts, the fewer the percentage that the customer might churn the company. 

4.  Explain **two** interactive controls in your dashboard and how _each_ enables the user to modify the presentation of the data.
 - ![[Pasted image 20210529223927.png]]
 - The team can click on the churn filter to view only the customers that have churn or customers that remain with the company. 
 - ![[Pasted image 20210529224118.png]]
 - The team can click on internet service to filter on how it affects churning. 
5.  Describe how you built your dashboard to be accessible for individuals with colorblindness.
- The dashboard was created with a colorblind palette. This ensures that only colors that colorblind people could see. 
6.  Explain how **two** data representations in your presentation support the story you wanted to tell.
 - ![[Pasted image 20210529224828.png]]
 -![[Pasted image 20210529224837.png]]
 - The story I am trying to tell is how much contract length matters and how we should adjust it going forward. The First contract I show is two years and one year. The visualization shows a small percentage of customers churning. Then I show the month-to-month visualization, and It shows that 37% of customers are churning. That is a 22% increase compared to the two-year contract. I used to color red to get a strong reaction from the audience. 
7.  Explain how you used audience analysis to adapt the message in your presentation.
	1.  The audience can analyze the jump in the graphs by looking at the bar charts and the percentages. The goal is to make the data information easy to understand. For, this reason I included the percentages in each graph. In addition, I made a scatter plot with bandwidth to illustrate how much bandwidth per year is used for customers who churn and does who do not churn. 
8.  Describe how you designed your presentation for universal access by all audiences			
	1.  - I made the presentation universal by making the graphs as simple as possible. I achieved this by using percentages instead of the sum of the numbers. I removed the ticks and lines from the three of the visualization to make it easy to see. I made x label a percentage to decrease confusion. I used the color red and blue only to make it easy to remember as the audience looks from graph to graph. 
9.  Explain **two** elements of effective storytelling that you implemented in your presentation and how _each_ element was intended to engage the audience.  
 - The storytelling had a question to get the audience's attention. The first visualization tried to show how low the churning was when the customer had a one-year contract. The second visualization showed a big jump in percentages of customers churning because of the month-to-month agreement. It showed the importance of the contract length and how important it is to the company. To further illustrate this point, we used another companies data to show how vital contract length is. The story ended with a summary.
