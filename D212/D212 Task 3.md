# **Part I: Research Question**

### A.  Describe the purpose of this data mining report by doing the following:

1.  Propose **one** question relevant to a real-world organizational situation that you will answer using market basket analysis.
One plan to reduce churn is to offer customers discounts on items of interest. what items are frequently bought together?
2.  Define **one** goal of the data analysis. Ensure that your goal is reasonable within the scope of the scenario and is represented in the available data.  
 - The goal of the data analysis is the find the top three group of items bought together. 

# **Part II: Market Basket Justification**

### B.  Explain the reasons for using market basket analysis by doing the following:

1.  Explain how market basket analyzes the selected dataset. Include expected outcomes.
- The market basket analyzes the data like a "if this, then that". Meaning if I buy an item then I most likely buy the other item and so on. The expected outcome is that we group the most frequently items bought together and able to find the top three. 
2.  Provide **one** example of transactions in the dataset.

In row 3 the customer bought the following items in one transaction: apple lighting, TP-link, and apple pencil. 
3.  Summarize **one** assumption of market basket analysis.  
The assumption is that joint occurrences of two or more items in most baskets are frequently bought together and compliment each other. Therefore, if one item is purchase it will lead to other purchases.   

# **Part III: Data Preparation and Analysis**

### C.  Prepare and perform market basket analysis by doing the following:

1.  Transform the dataset to make it suitable for market basket analysis. Include a copy of the cleaned dataset.
	- The first step is to drop all non transactions in the data.

	- ![[Pasted image 20210531194354.png]]
	- The df.dropna(how='all') removes rows that have all Na values
	- The next step is to go from a data frame to a list 
	- ![[Pasted image 20210531194500.png]]
	- The final step is to remove Na values from the list

2.  Execute the code used to generate association rules with the Apriori algorithm. Provide screenshots that demonstrate the error-free functionality of the code.

3.  Provide values for the support, lift, and confidence of the association rules table.

4.  Identify the top **three** rules generated by the Apriori algorithm. Include a screenshot of the top rules along with their summaries.  
 The association rule implies if item A is in the cart then item B will have a probability to be in the basket. 

# **Part IV: Data Summary and Implications**

### D.  Summarize your data analysis by doing the following:

1.  Summarize the significance of support, lift, and confidence from the results of the analysis.

2.  Discuss the practical significance of the findings from the analysis.

3.  Recommend a course of action for the real-world organizational situation from part A1 based on your results from part D1.  
 

# **Part V: Attachments**

### E.  Provide a Panopto video recording that includes a demonstration of the functionality of the code used for the analysis and a summary of the programming environment.  
 
### F.  Record _all_ web sources used to acquire data or segments of third-party code to support the application. Ensure the web sources are reliable.
