# **Part I: Research Question**

### A.  Describe the purpose of this data mining report by doing the following:

1.  Propose **one** question relevant to a real-world organizational situation that you will answer using market basket analysis.
One plan to reduce churn is to offer customers discounts on items of interest. What items are frequently bought together?
2.  Define **one** goal of the data analysis. Ensure that your goal is reasonable within the scope of the scenario and is represented in the available data.  
 - The goal of the data analysis is the find the top three items frequently bought together. 

# **Part II: Market Basket Justification**

### B.  Explain the reasons for using market basket analysis by doing the following:

1.  Explain how market basket analyzes the selected dataset. Include expected outcomes.
- The market basket analyzes the data like an "if this, then that." Meaning if I buy an item, then I most likely buy the other item and so on. The expected outcome is that we group the most frequently purchased items and find the top three. 
2.  Provide **one** example of transactions in the dataset.
![[Pasted image 20210531181028.png]]
In row 3, the customer bought the following items in one transaction: apple lighting, TP-link, and apple pencil. 
3.  Summarize **one** assumption of market basket analysis.  
The assumption is that joint occurrences of two or more items in most baskets are frequently bought together and compliment each other. Therefore, if one item is a purchase, it will lead to further purchases.    

# **Part III: Data Preparation and Analysis**

### C.  Prepare and perform market basket analysis by doing the following:

1.  Transform the dataset to make it suitable for market basket analysis. Include a copy of the cleaned dataset.
	- The first step is to drop all non transactions in the data.
	- ![[Pasted image 20210531194343.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20210531194354.png]]
	- The df.dropna(how='all') removes rows that have all Na values
	- The next step is to go from a data frame to a list 
	- ![[Pasted image 20210531194500.png]]
	- The final step is to remove Na values from the list 
	- ![[Pasted image 20210531194541.png]]
2.  Execute the code used to generate association rules with the Apriori algorithm. Provide screenshots that demonstrate the error-free functionality of the code.

3.  Provide values for the support, lift, and confidence of the association rules table.

![[Pasted image 20210531195020.png]]
4.  Identify the top **three** rules generated by the Apriori algorithm. Include a screenshot of the top rules along with their summaries.  
 The association rule implies if item A is in the cart then item B will have a probability to be in the basket. 
 ![[Pasted image 20210531194840.png]]
  support=0.005732568990801226, confidence=0.3006993006993007, lift=3.790832696715049

# **Part IV: Data Summary and Implications**

### D.  Summarize your data analysis by doing the following:

1.  Summarize the significance of support, lift, and confidence from the results of the analysis.
###### Support 
- The higher the support, the more likely the itemset ('HP 63XL Ink', '5pack Nylon Braided USB C cables') to be in a future transaction. 
###### Confidence
- The probability of a transaction that contains the items on the left-hand side of the rule. In the example above, the item on the left-hand side is HP 63 XL Ink.
###### Lift 
- lift summaries the strength of association between the products on the left and right-hand side of the rule; the more significant the lift, the greater the link between the two products
- **RelationRecord(items=frozenset({'Dust-Off Compressed Gas 2 pack', 'Nylon Braided Lightning to USB cable', '10ft iPHone Charger Cable 2 Pack', 'Screen Mom Screen Cleaner kit'}** 
- lift=3.7701704545454553 
- In our example above, since the lift is greater than 1, there is a likely high chance that the customer buys a 10 ft iPhone charger cable if they buy a cleaner kit and dust-off. 
2.  Discuss the practical significance of the findings from the analysis.
 - We found that the top three itemsets are ({'HP 63XL Ink', '5pack Nylon Braided USB C cables'}), ({'SanDisk Ultra 64GB card', 'AutoFocus 1080p Webcam'}), and ({'HP 63XL Ink', 'iPhone 11 case'}).
3.  Recommend a course of action for the real-world organizational situation from part A1 based on your results from part D1.  
 Now that we know the top three itemsets, we can offer deals on these itemsets to increase customers' chances of buying these items and including other items. In addition, we can decrease churning by offering discounts on particular itemsets.
