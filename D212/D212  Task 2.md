##### **Scenario 1**

One of the most critical factors in customer relationship management that directly affects a company’s long-term profitability is understanding its customers. When a company can better understand its customer characteristics, it is better able to target products and marketing campaigns for customers, resulting in better profits for the company in the long term.

You are an analyst for a telecommunications company that wants to better understand the characteristics of its customers. You have been asked to use principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze customer data to identify the principal variables of your customers, ultimately allowing better business and strategic decision-making.

# **Part I: Research Question**

### A.  Describe the purpose of this data mining report by doing the following:

1.  Propose **one** question relevant to a real-world organizational situation that you will answer by using principal component analysis (PCA).

2.  Define **one** goal of the data analysis. Ensure that your goal is reasonable within the scope of the scenario and is represented in the available data.  
 

# **Part II: Method Justification**

### B.  Explain the reasons for using PCA by doing the following:

1.  Explain how PCA analyzes the selected data set. Include expected outcomes.

2.  Summarize **one** assumption of PCA.  
 

# **Part III: Data Preparation**

### C.  Perform data preparation for the chosen dataset by doing the following:

1.  Identify the continuous dataset variables that you will need in order to answer the PCA question proposed in part A1.

2.  Standardize the continuous dataset variables identified in part C1. Include a copy of the cleaned dataset.  
 

# **Part IV: Analysis**

### D.  Perform PCA by doing the following:

1.  Determine the matrix of _all_ the principal components.

2.  Identify the _total_ number of principal components using the elbow rule or the Kaiser criterion. Include a screenshot of the scree plot.

3.  Identify the variance of _each_ of the principal components identified in part D2.

4.  Identify the _total_ variance captured by the principal components identified in part D2.

5.  Summarize the results of your data analysis.  
 

# **Part V: Attachments**

### E.  Record the web sources used to acquire data or segments of third-party code to support the analysis. Ensure the web sources are reliable.  
 

### F.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
