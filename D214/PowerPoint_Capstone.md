**Research Question:** Can a machine learning model be created statistically significantly to predict if a nursing home will be fined a ticket?

**Null Hypothesis**-: The null hypothesis states that there is not enough valuable information in the features that will aid in the prediction of the number of fines.

**Alternate Hypothesis**-: The alternative hypothesis states there is enough information valuable information in the features to predict the number of fines accurately.

##### The dataset started with 89 features and I was able to lower it to 57 features. To lower the features I used the Chi-squared.                                            ![[Pasted image 20210922141129.png]]
