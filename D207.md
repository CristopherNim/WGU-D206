#### A.  Describe a real-world organizational situation or issue in the Data Dictionary you chose, by doing the following:_
1. Provide **one** question that is relevant to your chosen data set. You will answer this question later in the task by analyzing the cleaned data using one of the following techniques: chi-square, t-test, or analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
	1.  Churn is one of the biggest problems in the industry. What are the features that lead to customers churning?
2. Explain how stakeholders in the organization could benefit from an analysis of the data.
	1. Knowing the key features to customers churning will allow the stakeholders to build a plan to improve customer retention 
3.  Identify _all_ of the data in your data set that are relevant to answering your question in part A1.
	1.  Here is a list of the accepted columns we plan on using.

#### B.  Describe the data analysis by doing the following:
1.  Using one of the following techniques, write code (in either Python or R) to run the analysis of the data set:
	+ chi-square
	+ t-test
	+  ANOVA
 2.  Provide the output and the results of _any_ calculations from the analysis you performed.

	 2.  ![[Pasted image 20210505194522.png]]
 3. Justify why you chose this analysis technique.
	 1.  I choose the chi-squared statistical technique to determine if churn and any categorical column have any relationship. If the columns accept the null hypothesis, the columns have no relationship else; if the alternative hypothesis is true, the column does have a relationship. 
	 2.  Here is a list of the accepted columns we will choose and the rejected columns we will not use.
	 3.  ![[Pasted image 20210505195057.png]]
 4. The Anova test will test if the feature churn has any relationship with any numerical column.
#### C.  Identify the distribution of **two** continuous variables and **two** categorical variables using univariate statistics from your cleaned and prepared data. 

##### Continuous variables

##### Categorical variables

#### D.  Identify the distribution of **two** continuous variables and **two** categorical variables using bivariate statistics from your cleaned and prepared data.
  1.  Represent your findings in Part D, visually as part of your submission.
##### Two continuous variables

##### Categorical variables

#### E.  Summarize the implications of your data analysis by doing the following:
 1. Discuss the results of the hypothesis test. 
	 1. The null hypothesis is stated that there is no relationship between the given column and the churn column. If the alternative hypothesis is accepted it means that there is a relationship with the given column and the churn column.  The following columns have a relationship with the churn column meaning that we accepted the alternative hypothesis. 
	 2.  ![[Pasted image 20210517185746.png]]
	
 2.  Discuss the limitations of your data analysis
	 1.  The limitation of the data analysis is that not all the columns are balanced. For example, the Techie column is 75% no and 25% yes. The unbalance might cause a type 1 error. Another possible limitation is that we might not have collected enough data to have statistical significance. 
 3.   Recommend a course of action based on your results.
	 4.   I would recommend collecting more data to balance the columns. Another solution is sampling the data, but this might cause a type 1 or type 2 error. 

#### G.  Reference the web sources used to acquire segments of third-party code to support the analysis. 

#### H.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
