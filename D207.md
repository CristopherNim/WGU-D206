#### A.  Describe a real-world organizational situation or issue in the Data Dictionary you chose, by doing the following:_
1. Provide **one** question that is relevant to your chosen data set. You will answer this question later in the task through an analysis of the cleaned data, using one of the following techniques: chi-square, t-test, or analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
	1.  Churn is one of the biggest problems in the telecom industry. What are the features that lead to customers churning?
2. Explain how stakeholders in the organization could benefit from an analysis of the data.
	1. Knowing the key features to customers churning will allow the stakeholders to build a plan to improve customer retention 
3.  Identify _all_ of the data in your data set that are relevant to answering your question in part A1.
	1.  This question is going to be answer after testing each feature.

#### B.  Describe the data analysis by doing the following:
1.  Using one of the following techniques, write code (in either Python or R) to run the analysis of the data set:
	+ chi-square
	+ t-test
	+  ANOVA
 2.  Provide the output and the results of _any_ calculations from the analysis you performed.
 3.  Justify why you chose this analysis technique.

#### C.  Identify the distribution of **two** continuous variables and **two** categorical variables using univariate statistics from your cleaned and prepared data. 
  1.  Represent your findings in Part C, visually as part of your submission.

#### D.  Identify the distribution of **two** continuous variables and **two** categorical variables using bivariate statistics from your cleaned and prepared data.
  1.  Represent your findings in Part D, visually as part of your submission.



#### E.  Summarize the implications of your data analysis by doing the following:
 1. Discuss the results of the hypothesis test. 
 2.  Discuss the limitations of your data analysis
 3.   Recommend a course of action based on your results.


#### G.  Reference the web sources used to acquire segments of third-party code to support the analysis.
